[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) is an amazing site. There are three aspects to this amazingness for me.

# Engaging and useful web design
I think the best way to get a sense of this is to click around. What I love:

- The main page is engaging. It's describes what it's about in the middle of the page ("Explore the ongoing history... through research and data visualization"), with the context that it's a "web publication" by someone named Max Roser. It points you towards the "latest visualization" (isn't that exciting?) which, at the time of writing, is a plot of life expectancy in several countries (with the option to add more) from 1543 to 2011. What a huge spread of time!

- In the header (on a big screen; hidden in menu on a small screen) there are links labelled by subject: population, health, food, .... I think that's exactly the right way to do it. A sidebar, for example, would take space from the content. On the other hand, one doesn't need to go to an index page to access all of the articles. And since they are named by subject (instead of by date, for example), it's very easy to zero in on what you may be interested in.

- The content pages are very practical.
