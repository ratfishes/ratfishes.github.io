title: "Headwinds and tailwinds"

I just listened to Freakonomics' March 17 episode ["Why is my life so hard?"](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-is-my-life-so-hard/) [^1] -- it was pretty interesting. It was about recent pysch research into how people tend to remember their "headwinds" i.e. obstacles, more than their "tailwinds" which propel them forward. They talked about the negative psychological effects of resentment and the benefits of gratitude, which indicates this headwind/tailwind asymmetry is detrimental to our psychological well-being. 

As they pointed out in the show, these ideas also seem related to recent politics. Consider the example of the Trump voter who relies on Obamacare-- lots of resentment for others who use resources from the state without consideration of the ways they themselves benefit. They see the obstacles in their own life and feel they deserve the access to healthcare but think others have it easier and don't deserve the same.

I think psychological well-being, an understanding how the world (many people have it *far* harder), and a true sense of gratitude are important ingredients for improving the world. I'm not quite sure how to propogate these things, but I can start with myself.

I've had a lot of tailwinds. It makes me feel guilty sometimes, and makes my life easier all the time. I'll list some of the most important ones here to make them more concrete for myself.

* My family. I have supportive parents who have given me great advice for navigating the western world and for academia, who have encouraged good mental habits, and a sense of personal responsibility. They have also provided extensive financial support, and they gave me the opportunity to focus on education without worrying about money or having to work. My sister too has shown me new perspectives and aspects of the world. As the older child also, she helped my parents figure out parenting first, making my life easier. She and my parents have also always made sure I've felt loved.
* My skin color and gender. I've almost always been given the benefit of the doubt, and never had to try very hard to be taken seriously intellectually. That seems especially helpful in the competitive strive to join academia. I've also been able to walk through life without thinking about race or gender much, and have never been discriminated against.
* My partner, who has influenced my perspective on basically everything worth thinking about, who has been a true collaborator in life and a major factor in my growth as a person.
* Access to the modern world! I'm typing on powerful hand computer while on an inexpensive intercontinental flight, 10,000 m in the air. 
* Mentors and community. 

Other things I'm grateful for, but I probably wouldn't call a "tailwind":

* food cultures
* humans have been to the moon
* dogs
* the fruits of the cumulative work of humanity, particularly science, increased tolerance and social improvements[^2], art
* plants, particularly delicious ones
* the dawn of good TV shows
* the beautiful complexities of human variation

I'm sure there is more; maybe I'll keep a running list.

By the way, dear reader, this post has an interpretation relating to a prior subject of this blog, i.e. rap. On his single "The Heart Part 4" for his upcoming album, Kendrick Lamar warned

>You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
>Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

but on April 7, there was only the announcement that his album would be released on April 14, instead of the release itself. We must be strong in the face of this blow, and remember to be grateful for the existence of Mr. Lamar, and the gift of another studio album.
