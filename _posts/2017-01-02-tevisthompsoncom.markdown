I like the website [http://tevisthompson.com/](http://tevisthompson.com/). It's the personal website of a writer named Tevis Thompson, who I think has excellent insight into video games. Some of the highlights for me:
- In his essay ["On Videogame Reviews"](http://tevisthompson.com/on-videogame-reviews/), he connects his criticism of *BioShock Infinite* to problems with the status-quo in video game design. It's a great (long) essay that makes points I've never seen elsewhere. It also resonates with my experience of *Bioshock Infinite*. I enjoyed the game for awhile, before gradually losing interest. I did not have the words or ideas to describe it as Tevis has, but in retrospect I agree with him (except maybe that it's "the worst game of the year", which he might've said just to clash with it's award as the "Game of the Year").
- He has [50 video game reviews](http://tevisthompson.com/game-review-drabbles/) which are exactly 100 words each. They are great poems and insightful commentary on the games.


I look forward to reading more of his essays when I get the chance (and the mood).
