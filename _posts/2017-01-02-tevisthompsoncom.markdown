I like the site [http://tevisthompson.com/](http://tevisthompson.com/). It's the personal website of a writer named Tevis Thompson, who I think has excellent insight into video games. Some of the highlights for me:

- In his essay ["On Videogame Reviews"](http://tevisthompson.com/on-videogame-reviews/), he connects his criticism of *BioShock Infinite* to problems with the status-quo in video game design. It's a great (long) essay that makes points I've never seen elsewhere. It also resonates with my experience of *Bioshock Infinite*. I enjoyed the game for awhile, before gradually losing interest. I did not have the words or ideas to describe it as Tevis has, but in retrospect I agree with him (except maybe that it's "the worst game of the year", which he might've said just to clash with its awards as "Game of the Year" by various publications).
- He has [50 video game reviews](http://tevisthompson.com/game-review-drabbles/) which are exactly 100 words each. They are great poems and insightful commentary on the games.


I look forward to reading more of his essays when I get the chance (and the mood).
